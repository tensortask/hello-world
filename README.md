# TensorTask: Decentralized Machine Intelligence for All

## Mission
* Create systems that maximize the collaboration between neural networks and data scientists in a decentralized manner.
* Turn the internet into a large interconnected neural net.
* Explore micro-payments as a means of incentivizing collaboration/development within data science.
* Open the benefits of machine intelligence to everyone (financially and technologically).

## Stealth Mode
TensorTask is in stealth mode while we develop the underlying technology. We believe in releasing high-quality and well-tested code. We also want to perform internal research, reach milestones, and undergo a security audit.

Approaching a public release, we will publish information on our internal research, milestones, and audits.

If you want to be notified of TensorTask's developments, sign up to our notification email list. We will only contact you regarding project updates.
