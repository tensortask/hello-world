# TensorTask: Decentralized AI for All

## Mission
* Create systems that maximize the collaboration between neural networks and data scientists in a decentralized manner.
* Turn the internet into a large interconnected neural net.
* Explore micro-payments as a means of incentivizing collaboration/development within data science.
* Make artificial intelligence and big data benefit everyone (financially and technologically).

## Stealth Mode
TensorTask is in stealth mode while we develop the underlying technology. We believe in releasing high-quality and well-tested code. We also want to perform internal research, reach milestones, and undergo a security audit.

Approaching a public release, we will publish information on our internal research, milestones, and audits.

If you want to be notified of TensorTask's developments, sign up to our notification email list. We will only contact you regarding project updates.

## FAQ

#### What does TensorTask projects do exactly?
We are building protocols that enable decentralized AI at a financial and technical level. More later.

#### Will your project be open-source?
Yes, and that's a promise.

#### What is TensorTask Incorporated's involvement?
TensorTask, Inc. is funding the research/development. However, to be explicit, the core project(s) will be completely open-source and fully-decentralized. **TensorTask, Inc. will NEVER be a required intermediary.** TensorTask, Inc. will simply be an early adopter of the technology(s) and may spawn for-profit products that supplement the ecosystem (think enterprise-level management, or simplified user experience).
